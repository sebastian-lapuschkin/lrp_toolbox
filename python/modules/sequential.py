            some optional validation data. used to measure network performance during training.
            shaped (M,D)

        Yval : numpy.ndarray

            the batch size to use for training

        iters : int
            max number of training iterations

        lrate : float
            the initial learning rate. the learning rate is adjusted during training with increased model performance. See lrate_decay

        lrate_decay : string
            controls if and how the learning rate is adjusted throughout training:
            'none' or None disables learning rate adaption. This is the DEFAULT behaviour.
            'sublinear' adjusts the learning rate to lrate*(1-Accuracy**2) during an evaluation step, often resulting in a better performing model.
            'linear' adjusts the learning rate to lrate*(1-Accuracy) during an evaluation step, often resulting in a better performing model.

        lfactor_initial : float
            specifies an initial discount on the given learning rate, e.g. when retraining an established network in combination with a learning rate decay,
            it might be undesirable to use the given learning rate in the beginning. this could have been done better. TODO: do better.
            Default value is 1.0

        status : int
            number of iterations (i.e. number of rounds of batch forward pass, gradient backward pass, parameter update) of silent training
            until status print and evaluation on validation data.

        convergence : int
            number of consecutive allowed status evaluations with no more model improvements until we accept the model has converged.
            Set <=0 to disable. Disabled by DEFAULT.
            Set to any value > 0 to control the maximal consecutive number (status * convergence) iterations allowed without model improvement, until convergence is accepted.

        transform : function handle
            a function taking as an input a batch of training data sized [N,D] and returning a batch sized [N,D] with added noise or other various data transformations. It's up to you!
            default value is None for no transformation.

        Performs LRP by calling subroutines, depending on lrp_var and param or
        preset values specified via Module.set_lrp_parameters(lrp_var,lrp_param)

        If lrp parameters have been pre-specified (per layer), the corresponding decomposition
        will be applied during a call of lrp().

        Specifying lrp parameters explicitly when calling lrp(), e.g. net.lrp(R,lrp_var='alpha',param=2.),
        will override the preset values for the current call.

        How to use:

        net.forward(X) #forward feed some data you wish to explain to populat the net.

        then either:

        net.lrp() #to perform the naive approach to lrp implemented in _simple_lrp for each layer

        or:

        for m in net.modules:
            m.set_lrp_parameters(...)
        net.lrp() #to preset a lrp configuration to each layer in the net

        or:

        net.lrp(somevariantname,someparameter) # to explicitly call the specified parametrization for all layers (where applicable) and override any preset configurations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        R : numpy.ndarray
            final layer relevance values. usually the network's prediction of some data points
            for which the output relevance is to be computed
            dimensionality should be equal to the previously computed predictions

        lrp_var : str
            either 'none' or 'simple' or None for standard Lrp ,
            'epsilon' for an added epsilon slack in the denominator
            'alphabeta' or 'alpha' for weighting positive and negative contributions separately. param specifies alpha with alpha + beta = 1
            'flat' projects an upper layer neuron's relevance uniformly over its receptive field.
            'ww' or 'w^2' only considers the square weights w_ij^2 as qantities to distribute relevances with.

        param : double
            the respective parameter for the lrp method of choice

        Returns
        -------

        R : numpy.ndarray
            the first layer relevances as produced by the neural net wrt to the previously forward
            passed input data. dimensionality is equal to the previously into forward entered input data

        Note
        ----

        Requires the net to be populated with temporary variables, i.e. forward needed to be called with the input
        for which the explanation is to be computed. calling clean in between forward and lrp invalidates the
        temporary data
